  <h1><em>What Should I Wear Today?</em> Tutorial</h1>
<p>Do you check the weather before deciding what to wear for the day? Of course you do! This customizable web app will allow you to use your local forecast data to recommend an outfit that will inspire you to become the fashionista that you have always wanted to be. 
The interactive tutorial will help you to learn how to <a href="#challenges">remix JavaScript</a>.
</p>
<p>After following the steps in the tutorial, your app will look something like this:</p>
<center><img src="img/app.png"></center>
<p>So, let's get started. Take a look at the code in the editor to the right and choose one of the buttons below:</p>
  <h3>What's all this stuff between lines 1-15?</h3>
  <div class="subheading"><em>Is my computer being hacked?!</em></div>

  <h1>Nope, it's code.</h1>
  <p>That is HTML, the language that all pages on the Web are made of.</p>
  <p><a href="#about-html" class="btn">Oh neat, tell me more.</a></p>
  <p><a href="#hack" class="btn">Ok, let's get started coding then!</a></p>
</section>

<section id="about-html">
  <h1>HTML is cool.</h1>
  <p>If a Web page were an organism, HTML would be like its bones,
    providing structure.</p>
  <p>HTML is made up of <em>tags</em>, which often come in pairs. For
    example, line 1 is an <em>opening</em> HTML tag, while line 15 is
    a <em>closing</em> HTML tag. You can identify tags by the
    <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> at either end.</p>
  <p>A pair of tags and the space between them is sometimes called a <em>block</em> or <em>element</em> of HTML. The space between can contain text or more <em>nested</em> elements; when <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/3D_View" target="_blank">visualized</a>, this can look like a series of boxes stacked atop one another.</p>
  <p>For example, lines 2-10 comprise the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element,
    while lines 11-14 form the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Both of
    these elements are nested in the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.</p>

  <aside class="media">
    <img src="img/tip.png">
    <p class="bd">If you'd like to learn more about tags, try playing <a href="https://mousemeredith.makes.org/thimble/LTE2Mjc5Nzk3NzY=/tag-tag-revolution-activity" target="_blank">Tag Tag Revolution</a> with some friends.</p>

  <h1>Let's start coding.</h1>
  <p>The first thing we'll do is add a <em>script</em> to this webpage.</p>
  <p>Scripts are like the brain, muscles, and central nervous system of a webpage: they allow a page to respond to user input, talk to the internet, and change itself in ways that can transform it from an inert page into a full-fledged application.</p>
  <p>To add our script, type the following at line 4:</p>

  <pre data-lang="htmlmixed" data-baseurlify>&lt;script src="{{{baseURL}}}weather-outfit.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

  <aside class="media">

  <h1>Put some clothes on that webpage!</h1>
  <p>The webpage now has a somewhat broken app in it, which you'll be fixing. Let's add a <em>stylesheet</em> to the page so it doesn't look gross.</p>
  <p>Stylesheets are written using a language called CSS, and are like the skin or clothing of a webpage: a set of rules draped over HTML to make it look pretty (or, in some cases, grotesque).</p>
  <p>To add our stylesheet, type the following at line 3:</p>

  </div>
</section>

<section id="cookbook">
  <h1>Recipes and cookbooks</h1>
  <p>Try using the app now.</p>
  <p>While it's prettier, it's also still broken: after you either enter the name of a place or use geolocation, there's an error on the page mentioning something about <code>getForecastOutfit is not defined</code>.</p>
  <p>Computers run JavaScript much the same way cooks follow recipes. Just as building a meal requires cooking and combining different recipes from cookbooks, JavaScript follows its own kind of recipes, called <em>functions</em>, to accomplish simple tasks.</p>
  <p>Here, the JavaScript brought into the page in line 4 is trying to call a function called <code>getForecastOutfit</code>, but it's not in any of the page's "cookbooks", so to speak.</p>
  <p>It's time to write that recipe.</p>
  <p><a href="#js" class="btn">Onwards!</a></p>
</section>

<section id="js" role="challenge" data-challenge-prereqs="load">
  <h1>Adding our own recipe</h1>
  <p>The opening <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag at line 5 tells the browser to start processing the text until the closing <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag at line 8 as JavaScript code. This is where we'll define our <code>getForecastOutfit</code> function.</p>
  <p>Type the following at line 6:</p>
  <pre data-lang="javascript" data-baseurlify>function getForecastOutfit(forecast) {
  return "{{{baseURL}}}img/eskimo-lomen-1915.jpg";
}</pre>
  <div role="challenge-status"></div>
  <div class="challenge-complete">
    <h2>Awesome.</h2>
    <p>Now that the function is defined, the app can find it and use it display an outfit to wear.</p>
    <p><a href="#explainjs" class="btn">But what does that code <em>mean</em>?</a></p>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="explainjs">
  <h1>Functions explained</h1>
  <p>A function has <em>input</em> and <em>output</em>.</p>
  <p>Recipes have input and output too: a chocolate chip cookie recipe takes raw ingredients&mdash;eggs, flour, chocolate chips&mdash;and produces cookies as its output.</p>
  <p>The function you just wrote takes a <em>weather forecast</em> as its input, and produces an <em>image URL</em> as its output.</p>
  <p><i class="fa fa-arrow-down"></i> Click on the input in the text below.</p>
  <pre>function getForecastOutfit<a class="highlight-on-hover" href="#arguments">(forecast)</a> {
  <span data-baseurlify>return "{{{baseURL}}}img/eskimo-lomen-1915.jpg"</span>;
}</pre>
</section>

<section id="arguments">
  <h1>Arguments: the input</h1>
  <pre>function getForecastOutfit<span class="highlight">(forecast)</span> {
  <span data-baseurlify>return "{{{baseURL}}}img/eskimo-lomen-1915.jpg"</span>;
}</pre>
  <p>The set of paretheses after the text <code>getForecastOutfit</code> make up the <em>arguments</em> of the function: the inputs that are handed to the function whenever it is <em>called</em>, or followed by the computer like a recipe. Think of the arguments as a sort of box that all the ingredients are put into before a chef starts cooking.</p>
  <p>In our case, <code>getForecastOutfit</code> only takes one argument, called <code>forecast</code>. This is a bundle of information about the weather forecast.</p>
  <p>When finished, the function returns an <em>image URL</em> as its output.</p>
  <p><i class="fa fa-arrow-down"></i> Click on the output in the text below.</p>
  <pre>function getForecastOutfit(forecast) {
  <a class="highlight-on-hover" href="#returnvalue" data-baseurlify>return "{{{baseURL}}}img/eskimo-lomen-1915.jpg"</a>;
}</pre>
</section>

<section id="returnvalue">
  <h3>Return value: the output</h3>
  <pre>function getForecastOutfit(forecast) {
  <span class="highlight" data-baseurlify>return "{{{baseURL}}}img/eskimo-lomen-1915.jpg"</span>;
}</pre>
  <p>A function always has a <em>return value</em>, which is like its output, or a box that a chef puts their cooked item into. The word <code>return</code> in our function tells the computer to stop following the recipe, and produce the URL following it as the function's output.</p>
  <p>Now let's personalize the app to make it your own.</p>
  <h3>How do I change the picture?</h3>
  <div class="subheading"><em>Eskimos are awesome, but I have something else in mind&hellip;</em></div>
  <a href="#remixjs" class="btn">Change the picture</a>
  <h3>How do I show a different picture based on the forecast?</h3>
  <div class="subheading">You can do this if you learn about <em>conditionals</em>.</div>
  <p><a href="#enhancejs" class="btn">Write a conditional</a></p>
</section>

<section id="remixjs">
  <h1>Changing the picture</h1>
  <p>To change the default Eskimo picture, you'll first want to find a new picture. You can do this via a <a href="https://www.google.com/imghp?as_st=y&amp;tbm=isch&amp;as_q=&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;cr=&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;safe=images&amp;tbs=sur:f&amp;gws_rd=ssl" target="_blank">Google search</a> for images labeled for noncommercial reuse.</p>
  <p>Once you find a good image, you'll want to copy its URL to your clipboard. Right-click or control-click on it, then select <em>Copy image location</em> (or <em>Copy image URL</em> or <em>Copy image address</em>, depending on your web browser).</p>

  <aside class="media">
    <img src="img/tip.png">
    <p class="bd">If you're having trouble copying the image URL, this guide on <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Get-the-URL-for-Pictures" target="_blank">how to get the URL for pictures</a> may help.</p>
  </aside>

  <p>Delete the Eskimo picture URL after the word <code>return</code> in the <code>getForecastOutfit</code> function that you typed <a href="#js">earlier</a>. Your cursor should be between a pair of double quotes, and the function should now look like this:</p>
  <pre data-lang="javascript">function getForecastOutfit(forecast) {
  return "";
}</pre>
  <p>Now paste the URL from your clipboard so it fits between the pair of double quotes. You're done!</p>

  <h1>Enhancing the recipe</h1>
  <p>Try entering the names of different cities into the app.</p>
  <p>As you'll see, while the app doesn't <em>crash</em>, it's still a bit broken, because it's always telling you to wear the same outfit regardless of what the forecast is!</p>
  <p>To fix this, you'll want to change the <em>algorithm</em> that the function uses. An algorithm is just a fancy word for "recipe".</p>
  <p><a href="#conditionals" class="btn">How can I change the algorithm?</a></p>
</section>

<section id="conditionals" role="challenge" data-challenge-id="temperature" data-challenge-prereqs="load">
  <h1>Conditional Logic</h1>
  <p>To make <code>getForecastOutfit</code> return a different outfit depending on the forecast, you'll want to add a bit of <em>conditional logic</em> to your algorithm.</p>
  <p>When following a recipe, sometimes you need to follow slightly different instructions depending on your ingredients, or the preferences of your customers. For instance, if you want thinner pancakes, then you will want to add more milk to your batter than usual.</p>
  <p>That's all conditional logic is: a statement that matches the pattern, &ldquo;if <em>some condition</em> is true, then <em>do something</em>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the case of your algorithm, you can use conditional logic to return a different outfit based on the weather conditions.</p>
  <h3>Conditionals based on temperature</h3>
  <p>Use the translator below to learn how to add conditional logic to your code that returns a particular outfit if certain temperature conditions hold true.</p>
  <form role="snippet-wizard">
    <blockquote>
      If the forecast temperature
      <select name="unit">
        <option value="f">in Fahrenheit</option>
        <option value="c">in Celsius</option>
      </select>
      is
      <select name="operator">
        <option value=">">greater than</option>
        <option value="<">less than</option>
      </select>
      <input type="number" name="amount" placeholder="amount (in degrees)" value="0">
      then return
      <input type="url" name="url" placeholder="http://" value="http://some/picture" data-stringify>.
    </blockquote>
    <pre role="template">if (forecast.temp.{{{unit}}} {{{operator}}} {{{amount}}}) {
  return {{{url}}};
}</pre>
  </form>
  <p>It's important to note that <code>return</code> immediately causes the computer to "leave" the function, ignoring any further instructions in the recipe. So we can insert a conditional into the beginning of our <a href="#js">original</a> function like so:</p>
  <pre data-lang="javascript" data-baseurlify>function getForecastOutfit(forecast) {
  if (forecast.temp.f > 0) {
    return "http://some/picture";
  }
  return "{{{baseURL}}}img/eskimo-lomen-1915.jpg";
}</pre>
  <p>Can you guess what temperature range the Eskimo outfit will be recommended? When would the other one be recommended?</p>
  <p>Now see if you can change your code to return a different outfit when the weather forecast is 0 degrees Celsius and 100 degrees Celsius.</p>

<section id="debug">
  <h1>Enabling debug mode</h1>
  <p>Some apps have a built-in <em>debug mode</em> or <em>development mode</em> that makes it easier to tinker with the app and quickly see how it reacts to different inputs.</p>
  <p>Such a feature is particularly useful with this weather app. For instance, if you want to make sure your app provides the right outfit when it's hot and sunny outside, you don't want to have to wait until those weather conditions actually occur in real-life just to make sure your code behaves the way you intended.</p>
  <p>You can enable this app's debug mode by adding the following code to line 7:</p>
  <pre data-lang="javascript">DEBUG = true;</pre>
  <p>Once you do this, you'll see a debug panel in your app that you can use to quickly change the forecast conditions and see how your code responds to them.</p>
  <p>To disable the debug mode, you can change the word <code>true</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>
</section>

<section id="title" role="challenge" data-challenge-prereqs="load">
  <h1>Personalize the page title.</h1>
  <p>See the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element at line 9? That tells

  <p>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element at line 12 is part of the page
    body and shows the app's title on the page itself.</p>
  <p>Try changing the text of both elements to something a bit more
    unique. For instance, if your name is Pat, you could change the
    text to <em>What Should Pat Wear Today?</em>.</p>

<section id="about-weather-outfit-dot-js">
  <h1>About weather-outfit.js</h1>
  <p>The script you <a href="#hack">inserted</a> around line 4, <code>weather-outfit.js</code>, is actually a big bundle of different things.</p>
  <p>Among the bundle are a variety of JavaScript <em>libraries</em>, or "cookbooks", that the browser uses to power the app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, which makes it easier to write code that manipulates the contents of web pages.</li>
    <li><a href="http://documentcloud.github.io/underscore/" target="_blank">underscore.js</a>, which makes it easier to do a variety of common things with JavaScript.</li>
    <li><a href="http://documentcloud.github.io/backbone/" target="_blank">backbone.js</a>, a toolkit that makes it easier to build web pages that work like full-fledged applications.</li>
    <li><a href="http://mustache.github.io/" target="_blank">mustache</a>, a very simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor" target="_blank">template processor</a> that makes it easy for the app to insert data (like forecast information or error text) into HTML snippets.</li>
    <li><a href="http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/" target="_blank">dat.gui</a>, which powers the app's handy <a href="#debug">debug panel</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The file also contains all the default HTML templates that are used by the app, which <a href="#templates">you can remix</a>.</p>
  <p>Finally, <code>weather-outfit.js</code> also contains some JavaScript that uses the libraries to create and power the app itself. Explaining how this code works is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you can always <a href="https://github.com/toolness/weather-outfit-fun/tree/gh-pages/src" target="_blank">browse the source code</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="api">
  <h1>Where the forecasts come from</h1>
  <p>This app communicates with the <a href="http://openweathermap.org/" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap</a> site to obtain the latest forecast for any location.</p>
  <p>When one piece of software talks to another it is done through an <em>interface</em>, which is a very detailed set of instructions describing how to converse.</p>
  <p>One example of a simple interface is actually the <code><a href="#js">getForecastOutfit</a></code> function you create in this tutorial. The interface for this function could be described as "if you give me a forecast, I will return to you a URL pointing to a picture of an outfit to wear."</p>
  <p>When a person or organization has created an interface that allows other software to do something useful, they sometimes call it an <em>application programming interface</em>, or API.</p>
  <p>OpenWeatherMap offers a <a href="http://openweathermap.org/current" target="_blank">current weather data API</a> which <code><a href="#about-weather-outfit-dot-js">weather-outfit.js</a></code> communicates with after the user gives the app their location information.</p>
